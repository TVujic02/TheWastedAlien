   compartments with ingrdients in the fridge which you can access by clicking the numbers on the side.
3. To see which ingredients you need for a specific drink, click the recepies button in the top right corner and then the desired drink.
   (From the recepies menu you can also return to the main menu or clear your working station if you feel overloaded with ingredients)
4. To mix a drink, place your desired ingriedients in the drink mixer (in the middle of the screen) by draging an ingredient on top of it and start shaking!
   On the bottom of the screen you will see which ingredients are in the mixer. If you want to remove the ingredients in the mixer, simply click the backwards arrow button.
5. When a drink is finished mixing a screen will pop up with the drinks name and some information about the drink, when you click this goes away and the drink will
   spawn on the drink tray. To give a customer their drink, simply drag it on top of them.

   Now you know how to play the game! Some of the ingredients can be turned into other ingredients with the help of the utensils standing on the bar.
   To turn a ingredient into another, drag the ingredient onto one of the utensils. Try to experiment and find which ingredients turn into diffirent ones!
